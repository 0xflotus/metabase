## Metabase for big companies with big problems

Before we get into the nitty gritty of individual features, let's talk about where you'll be once you work your way through this guide. By the end of it, your users will be able to access your Metabase instance via SSO and will have an account automatically created for them with the correct group and permissions settings applied. Depending on the permissions settings you set up, your users will also have their views of specific tables filtered automatically based on the group(s) they belong to. As more people in your organization start to use Metabase, you'll be able to keep tabs on data access and usage in the Audit section. And for icing on the cake, your instance will also have your own company logo and brand colors.
