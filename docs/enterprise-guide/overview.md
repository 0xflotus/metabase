## An overview of setting up the Enterprise edition of Metabase

Before we get into the nitty gritty of individual features, let's talk about where you'll be once you work your way through this guide. By the end of it, your users will be able to access your Metabase instance via SSO and will have an account automatically created for them with the correct group and permissions settings applied. Depending on the permissions settings you choose, users in the groups you specify will also have their views of specific tables filtered automatically based on their user attributes. And for icing on the cake, your instance will also have your own company logo and brand colors.

### Enabling enterprise features

First off, make sure that you're running the Enterprise edition of Metabase (distinct from the open-source version). After going through the initial Metabase setup, to activate all the enterprise features go to the Admin Panel by clicking the top-right menu, then the Enterprise tab. From there, enter the token that you received in your email after either signing up for the free trial or after purchasing your enterprise license.
