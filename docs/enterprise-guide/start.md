## Managing large-scale deployments of Metabase

The Enterprise Edition of Metabase gives you the tools you need to roll Metabase out to hundreds or thousands of users and manage them with ease. Here's what we'll be going over:

* [An overview of setting up the Enterprise edition](overview.md)
* [Letting your users access Metabase with SSO](setting-up-sso.md)
* [Automatically filtering data for specific groups with sandboxes](data-sandboxes.md)
* [Customizing how Metabase looks with white labeling](whitelabeling.md)
* [Customizing drill-through for charts and tables](customizing-drill-through.md)
* [Copying contents of one Metabase instance to another (serialization)](serialization.md)
