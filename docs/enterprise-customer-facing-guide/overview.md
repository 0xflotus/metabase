## An overview of setting up your instance for customers

Before we start, this guide presumes that your situation is that you have some customers, clients, stakeholders, or other interested parties who are outside of your own organization, and you'd like to let them log in to your Metabase instance.

The problem that typically comes along with this is that you have plenty of things that you *don't* want them to see: internal company dashboards, data tables that may contain information of *other* customers, and more.

And maybe as much as you love Metabase's UI, you'd also like to make it look more like your own company's branding so that your customers don't get all confused.

If your head is nodding up and down, then great, stick around. This guide will go over solutions for all those problems.
