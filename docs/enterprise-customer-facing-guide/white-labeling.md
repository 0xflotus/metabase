## White labeling Metabase

White labeling lets you customize the way Metabase looks so that it matches your company’s branding or the colors in your app's UI. Go to the Admin Panel and click on the White Labeling section to start customizing things. Here’s what you can do:

### Change the name of the application
You can change every place within Metabase where it uses the word “Metabase” to instead use something like “Acme Analytics,” or whatever you want to call your Metabase app.

### Logo
You can replace Metabase’s familiar, tasteful, inspired-yet-not-threateningly-avant-garde dotted M logo with your very own. For things to work best, the logo you upload should be an SVG file that looks good when it’s around 60px tall. (In other words, ask the nearest designer for help.)

### Change the color palette
You can customize the colors that Metabase uses throughout the app:
* **Primary color:** by default, this is the lovely blue that is used for the nav bar, links, buttons, and more.
* **Nav bar color:** you can optionally specify a separate color for the nav bar; otherwise it defaults to the Primary color.
* **Accent colors:** these are the colors that are used for some icons, secondary buttons, elements of the graphical query builder, and chart colors.
* **Additional chart colors:** as the name implies, these are additional colors that are included in the charting options to give your lines, bars, and pie slices some extra pizazz.
